Fullangr was born a dwarf
but towered over his kind
from a very young age.
His incredible growth
has left him the size
of an ordinary man.

He is fascinated by every
form of weapon, and uses
many of them in combat.
Fullangr is versatile in
that his array of weapons
allows him to do whatever
is needed of him.

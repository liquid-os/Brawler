Keralyn was once a 
promising young woman
with as many dreams as
she could come up with.
Then, she died. 'Luckily'
for us her father was an
alchemist, and he was able
to bring her back. While a
good idea at the time, she
turned out to be undead,
and ended up slaughtering
her loved ones and all those
who lived in her town.

Enjoys long walks on the
beach.

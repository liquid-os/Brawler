Born literally of ancient
roots, Leadbark was feared
by many on his conquest of
all the cities around his
family's forest.

After he rid his homeland
of the human incursion,
the great ent was kidnapped
by bandits and forced to 
fight in an arena for nine
years before murdering each
and every one of the bandits
that had captured him and
setting himself free.
